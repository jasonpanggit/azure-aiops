## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Build on existing FastAPI, Next.js, OneLake/Delta, Fabric, Entra, and Terraform foundations.
- Sequence evidence and approval before any write adapter; keep remediation typed, allowlisted, bounded, and human-approved.
- Treat Fabric Ontology as a projection and Azure services as systems of record.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Validate exact provider contracts, permissions, pagination, watermarks, retention, and cross-domain identity normalization.
- Phase 2: Select and validate durable workflow and approval expiry semantics.
- Phase 3: Validate remediation API versions, rollback semantics, execution identity, and AI/data boundaries.
