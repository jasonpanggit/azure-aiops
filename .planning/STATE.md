# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-23)

**Core value:** Operators can move from a detected Azure situation to an evidence-backed, auditable, human-approved remediation without losing context or control.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Evidence and Situation Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Evidence and Situation Foundation)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-08-23 — Created brownfield MVP roadmap with complete v1 requirement coverage.

Progress: ██░░░░░░░░ [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Build on existing FastAPI, Next.js, OneLake/Delta, Fabric, Entra, and Terraform foundations.
- Sequence evidence and approval before any write adapter; keep remediation typed, allowlisted, bounded, and human-approved.
- Treat Fabric Ontology as a projection and Azure services as systems of record.
- [Phase ?]: Use compact immutable Pydantic situation/evidence records with deterministic IDs and keep raw provider payloads outside API responses.
- [Phase ?]: Preserve overlapping pre-existing worktree edits and commit only newly owned situation foundation files.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Validate exact provider contracts, permissions, pagination, watermarks, retention, and cross-domain identity normalization.
- Phase 2: Select and validate durable workflow and approval expiry semantics.
- Phase 3: Validate remediation API versions, rollback semantics, execution identity, and AI/data boundaries.
